Some of the problems occurred mostly in the cities such as: Monitoring the city conditions can be done with sensor
 The networks. Sensors can be placed at certain places to capture complexity of urban transport and congestion

problems important data. Wireless Sensor Networking (WSN) solutions
for Smart Cities are being driven by standards such as IEEE

 Health care issues 802.15.4 and ZigBe and other standards.
 Waste management, especially in big cities From previous work, we have developed part of smart city
